\description{
Experiment carried out in a vegetation house with
soybeans. The experiment has two plants by plot with three levels of
the factor amount of water in the soil (\code{water})
and five levels of potassium fertilization (\code{pot}).
The plots were arranged in five blocks (\code{block}).
Three response variables are of the interest, namely, grain yield,
number of seeds and number of viable peas per plant.
The data set has 75 observations of 7 variables.

\itemize{

\item \code{pot} - Factor five levels of potassium fertilization.

\item \code{water} - Factor three levels of amount of water in the soil.

\item \code{block} - Factor five levels.

\item \code{grain} - Continuous - Grain yield per plant.

\item \code{seeds} - Count - Number of seeds per plant.

\item \code{viablepeas} - Binomial - Number of viable peas per plant.

\item \code{totalpeas} - Binomial - Total number of peas per plant.
