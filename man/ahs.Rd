\description{
The Australian health survey was used by Bonat and
    Jorgensen (2016) as an example of multivariate count regression
    model. The data consists of five count response variables
    concerning health system access measures and nine covariates
    concerning social conditions in Australian for 1987-88.

\itemize{

\item \code{sex} - Factor with levels \code{male} and \code{female}.

\item \code{age} - Respondent's age in years divided by 100.

\item \code{income} - Respondent's annual income in Australian
    dollars divided by 1000.

\item \code{levyplus} - Coded factor. If respondent is covered by
    private health insurance fund for private patients in public
    hospital with doctor of choice (1) or otherwise (0).

\item \code{freepoor} - Coded factor. If respondent is covered by
    government because low income, recent immigrant, unemployed (1)
    or otherwise (0).

\item \code{freerepa} - Coded factor. If respondent is covered free
    by government because of old-age or disability pension, or
    because invalid veteran or family of deceased veteran (1) or
    otherwise (0).

\item \code{illnes} - Number of illnesses in past 2 weeks, with 5 or
    illnesses coded as 5.

\item \code{actdays} - Number of days of reduced activity in the past
    two weeks due to illness or injury.

\item \code{hscore} - Respondent's general health questionnaire score
    using Goldberg's method. High score indicates poor health.

\item \code{chcond} - Factor with three levels. If respondent has
    chronic condition(s) and is limited in activity (\code{limited}),
    or if the respondent has chronic condition(s) but is not limited
    in activity (\code{nonlimited}) or otherwise (\code{otherwise},
    reference level).

\item \code{Ndoc} - Number of consultations with a doctor or
    specialist (response variable).

\item \code{Nndoc} - Number of consultations with health
    professionals (response variable).

\item \code{Nadm} - Number of admissions to a hospital, psychiatric
    hospital, nursing or convalescence home in the past 12 months
    (response variable).

\item \code{Nhosp} - Number of nights in a hospital during the most
    recent admission.

\item \code{Nmed} - Total number of prescribed and non prescribed
    medications used in the past two days.
